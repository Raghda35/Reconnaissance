# Reconnaissance

Systems, networks, and potential targets to identify vulnerabilities and assess security risks. This process helps cybersecurity professionals understand the environment before conducting penetration tests or implementing defense strategies.

## Types of Information Gathering

### 1. Passive Information Gathering

Involves collecting data without directly interacting with the target.

The target does not know it's being analyzed.

Examples: Google search, WHOIS lookup, Shodan, DNS info, social media profiles.

### 2. Active Information Gathering

Involves direct interaction with the target system or network.

This may alert the target or trigger security defenses.

Examples: Port scanning with Nmap, ping sweeps, banner grabbing.

## Stages of Information Gathering

1. Target Identification: Define the scope: domain name, IP address, organization, or individual.

2. Footprinting (Public Information Collection): Collect general data from public sources like websites, forums, and social networks.

3. DNS and IP Analysis: Discover subdomains, IP addresses, name servers, and mail servers.

4. Port and Service Scanning: Use tools to find open ports and active services on the target system.

5. OS and Application Fingerprinting: Identify the target's operating system and software versions.

6. Vulnerability Identification: Detect potential security flaws or misconfigurations.
